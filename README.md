# RockPaperScissors project

You will create a smart contract named `RockPaperScissors` whereby:  
Alice and Bob can play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors using ERC20 (of your choosing).    
  
- To enroll, each player needs to deposit the right token amount, possibly zero.  
- To play, each Bob and Alice need to submit their unique move.  
- The contract decides and rewards the winner with all token wagered.  

There are many ways to implement this, so we leave that up to you.  
  
## Stretch Goals
Nice to have, but not necessary.
- Make it a utility whereby any 2 people can decide to play against each other.  
- Reduce gas costs as much as possible.
- Let players bet their previous winnings.  
- How can you entice players to play, knowing that they may have their funds stuck in the contract if they face an uncooperative player?  
- Include any tests using Hardhat.
